This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.\n                        </p>\n                        <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>\n                        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to XpressCure or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical,technical, or managerial safeguards.\n\n                        </p>\n                        <h3>Could my information be transferred to other countries?\n                        </h3>\n                        <p>XpressCure is incorporated in India.

We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.\n                       </p>\n                       <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:\n                       </p>\n                       <p>● Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.\n                       </p>\n                       <p>● Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose.\n                           Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.\n\n                       </p>\n                       <p>● Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.\n                       </p>\n                       <p>\n                         ● People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data.

It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we   already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.\n                       </p>\n                       <h3>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Acces,Portability and Deletion\n                       </h3>\n                       <p> We are committed to helping our customers meet the  data subject rights requirements of GDPR.
